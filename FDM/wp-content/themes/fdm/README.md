# Dev Build
Dev Build is a combination of code from various sources, including HTML5 Boilerplate and the latest Wordpress Default Themes.  
It stands as a 'starting theme' for use on new Projects, and can be customised as you see fit.


## IMPORTENT SIDE INFO.
When working with SASS a good rule of thumb is to not nest more than 3 deep as this can make it more difficult to understand and makes the point of SASS redundant.
However when working with BEM and SASS this may become more challenging.
